 <ul>
   <li><h3>Pink Floyd - The Dark Side of the Moon (1973)</h3>

      <p>One of the best-selling albums of all time as well as one of the greatest. <br>
         Pink Floyd's concept album revolving around themes such as madness, the stress of modern life, greed, death and relationships is a landmark statement in popular music. <br>
         The rich instrumentals and musical arrangement alongside Roger Waters' lyrics about the aforementioned themes makes this album a blockbuster achievement both commercially and artistically <br>
         The music, relevant lyrics and the high quality production values makes this a rare album that will stand the test of time. <br>

      <li><h3>Black Sabbath - Black Sabbath (1970)</h3>
         <img src="https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/6f/4f/3a/6f4f3a7d-8bad-c8a9-c65f-c525170aa1ed/0602537422630.jpg/500x0w.webp" alt="">
         <p>
            The one that started a whole new genre. <br>
            The sparse but heavy tritone riff from the title track (played by the legendary Tony Iommi) sets the bleak mood that is further accentuated by Bill Ward's thunderous drumming, Geezer Butler's rumbling bass and Ozzy Osbourne's banshee-like vocals. <br>
            Black Sabbath have made better and more refined heavy metal albums and obviously the genre has expanded beyond the simple but heavier blues and jazz elements heard on the album <br>
            But nothing else quite encapsulates the sentiments expressed by heavy metal than the first one. <br>
            Bleak, eerie, groovy, heavy and timeless. If there was a template for starting a whole new kind of music, it would be this one <br>
